# Pop Raja - Changelog and quality rules

Documentation baseline: 2026-10-09. Earlier project history remains in Git commits; this file does not invent a day-one audit.

## Quality rules (adopted 2026-10-09)

These are project requirements, not a claim that every check has passed.

- Use free services, libraries, fonts and licensed assets only. Never bypass security or publish secrets.
- Find the root cause and all occurrences of a bug; use shared fixes. Preserve working features and design. Check other projects for the same pattern.
- Keep a numbered task checklist. Finish and test tasks in logical order. Record completed and pending work honestly.
- Read existing code before changes. Check official documentation, compare suitable options, and make small, clear commits.
- Test the live site at 320, 375, 414 and 430px and desktop: layout, buttons, forms, validation, double-submit protection, navigation, overlays, performance, error/empty/loading states, accessibility and SEO.
- Keep Telugu and English readable and clear. Existing voice features need clear states, friendly permission errors and a typing fallback.
- Version assets and update service workers safely. Preserve user input, PINs, notes and progress. Migrate obsolete storage carefully; never wipe useful data to force an update.
- Check refresh, reopen, offline and slow-network behavior, timers, dates, races and duplicate code. Wait for GitHub Pages to serve a deployment and test the served version before completion.
- For blockers, compare three safe/free approaches; choose an in-scope fallback and continue independent work. Label sample or cached data. Never present it as current verified data.
- Report root cause, fixes, extra findings, actual test methods, untested/pending items, blockers/workarounds and a mobile test checklist. Distinguish Chrome emulation from real iPhone/Samsung testing. Do not claim perfect reliability.
- New projects retain editable source, change notes and appropriate licensed assets. Books require end-to-end text, layout, Telugu-font and current publishing-guideline checks.

## Backup and rollback

Pre-audit backup branch: `safety-2026-10-09-pre-audit`.
This snapshots main before this documentation change. It is a rollback reference, not a second production branch. No app feature is changed by this setup.

## Known changes

- 2026-10-09: Safety documentation baseline established. Existing in-app help is retained; no duplicate guide or feature edit in this setup.

## Known limitations and pending checks

- Full whole-app audit under the new checklist is pending.
- Phone crash reports were not reproduced in Chrome smoke tests; the actual device cause remains unverified.
- Shared-board/challenge links and all game flows need complete live regression coverage in the forthcoming audit.
- Real iPhone Safari and Samsung Internet device testing remains unverified.

## Mobile check after later changes

Open the live app, switch Telugu/English, use main screens and Back, close overlays, refresh/reopen, and verify saved input/progress. Report the screen and exact steps if something fails.
